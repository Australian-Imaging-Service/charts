# Operational recommendations

The `/docs/_operational` folder is a dump directory for any documentation related to the day-to-day runnings of AIS released services. This includes, but is not limited to, operational tasks such as:

* Administration tasks
* Automation
* Release management
* Backup and disaster recovery

Jekyll is used to render these documents and any MarkDown files with the appropriate `FrontMatter` tags will appear in the `Operational` drop-down menu item.
