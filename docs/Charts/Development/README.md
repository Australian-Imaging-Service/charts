# Development instructions, recommendations, etc...

The `/docs/_development` folder is a dump directory for any documentation related to setup and practices of development related to the AIS released services.

Jekyll is used to render these documents and any MarkDown files with the appropriate `FrontMatter` tags will appear in the `Development` drop-down menu item.
