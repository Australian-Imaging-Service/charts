# Deployments of AIS released service

The `/docs/Deployment` folder is a dump directory for any documentation related to deployment of the AIS released services. This includes, but is not limited to, deployment examples:

* from different AIS sites
* utilising alternate Cloud services or on-prem deployments
* configuration snippets

Jekyll is used to render these documents and any MarkDown files with the appropriate `FrontMatter` tags will appear in the `Deployment` drop-down menu item.
